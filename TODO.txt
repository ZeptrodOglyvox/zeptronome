- Settings page with:
    MORE COLORS
    Choices for the logic below

- Better recorder logic:
    press record -> pause player first
    press play -> pause record first 
    play button should always be pressable or become pressable as soon as record is hit
    press delete -> pause everything first

- Metronome interaction with recorder:
    - metronome automatically pauses when play is hit, and resumes when playback is finished
    - if play is hit on the metronome during playback, play stops

- Try to improve the metronome startup thing and also figure out why playback transfers to the small speaker randomly 
- Tap tempo
- Recorder does some sort of compress+gain on the recording.
- Timer for breaks
